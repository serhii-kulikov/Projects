Graphical comparison of the speed of execution of sorting algorithms 
====================================================================
In the repository `Projects / Algorithms / SortAlgorytms /` there are files `main.py` and` class_Sort_Alg.py` and a number of .txt files. The .py files are executed in Python3.8.5.
***
The file `class_Sort_Alg.py` is a class file. The file stores sorting algorithms Counting, Insertion, Heap, Quick, Bubble. It can be supplemented in the future.
***
The `main.py` file performs several tasks. 
1. Sorting an array from random data with parameters: `len_mas` - its the length of array, `min_val` - the minimum value in the array, `max_val` - maximum value in the array. Data is written to files in .txt format, with the possibility of rewriting.
2. Graphic output of data that is written to .txt files.
