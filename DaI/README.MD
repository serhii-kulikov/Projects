Differentiator and Integrator
====================================================================
In the repository `Projects / DaI/` there are files `main.py`, `class_DaI.py`, `Initial_File.py` and a number of .txt files. The .py files are executed in Python3.8.5.
***
The file `class_DaI.py` is a class file. The file stores functions of differentiation and integration of the input signal.
***
The `main.py` file performs several tasks.  
1. The file accepts a signal (data set in .txt format) as an input and writes the received processing result in Int_File.txt or Diff_File.txt.
2. Graphic output of data that is written to .txt files.
***
The `Initial_File.py` creates an input signal.
