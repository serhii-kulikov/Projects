Calculates the area under the curve with the Monte-Carlo Method
====================================================================
In the repository `Projects / Square / MMK /` there are files `main.py` and` Class_MMKS.py` and a number of .txt files. The .py files are executed in Python3.8.5.
***
The file `class_MMKS.py` is a class file. The file stores `class Plot` and `class FtoL`. 
1. `class Plot` have 2 functions, that create file with coordinates of Rectangel and create file with coordinates of Dots.
2. `class Func` have 3 functions, that plot dots of input function, dots and counting the square under the curve.
***
The `main.py` file imports the functions of generating points and curve. And with the Monte Carlo Method calculates the area under the curve.
